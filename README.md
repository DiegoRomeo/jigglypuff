From the description this pokemon seems a bit like my extremely booring italian/latin teacher.
During a lesson on Seneca I came up with the idea of writing this tool (with a bit of irony).
My goal is to automatically edit the audio recordings taken during the lessons so that later when studying I can re-listen to them and edit my notes.
